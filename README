Binary Classifier for Prenominal Adjectival Ordering

NOTE: IF adj_emb0.npy and adj_emb1.npy are in the current directory
then you do not need to parse the corpora! Simply run train.py in terminal!

Instructions to build datasets and train the model from scratch:

Set up:

Required python packages:
numpy
torch
bcolz
pickle

How the directory is organized:
"master" folder:
	dataset.py, 
	model.py, 
	process_bnc.py, 
	process_ptb.py, 
	tools.py, 
	train.py, 
	vectorize.py

	"data" folder:
		empty

	"glove" folder:
		glove.6b.50d.txt (obtain from GloVe website)

	"BNC" folder": (contains British National Corpus)
		**CONTENTS OF BNC**
	"treebank_3" folder: (contains Penn Treebank)
		**CONTENTS OF PTB**

Datasets:
If not included, full Penn Treebank corpus and British National Corpus should be in the same directory 

Before you run train, you must prepare the data
1) Load in and extract prenominal adjective pairs 
using process_bnc.py and process_ptb.py
2) Combine outputs of process_bnc and process_ptb into one text file, adj_all.txt
3) Use vectorize.py to convert adjectives to model inputs


Here are the terminal commands you can follow in sequence 
You must be in master directory to begin($cd ~/USER/pathto/master)

$python process_ptb.txt
$python process_bnc.txt
$cd data
$cat adj_bnc.txt > adj_all.txt
$cat adj_ptb.txt >> adj_all.txt
$cd ..
$python vectorize.py

Now data is ready and you can begin training the model
$python train.py

You can edit tests by editting myadjpairs list at the end of train.py
